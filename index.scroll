# Plan:

[] Display camera view in webbrowser
[] Detect tagged objects/papers
[] Parse "programs" written on those objects
[] Execute programs
[] Project outputs onto surface

# Equipment needed:

[] Webcam
[] Projector

# Core Concept (theories):
(Is there any place where the core concepts are listed?)

- Surfaces (ie, pieces of paper)
- Programs on those surfaces
- Cameras
- Projectors

I'm assuming there are processes? Is there internal state (hidden memory)? Users?
